      <p>Hi, My name is Chris. I'm an avid surfer, traveler, positive vibe seeker, and animal lover. I have traveled solo to multiple countries, and found over time that exploring is where my heart lays. I don't want to live a life full of regrets and negative engery. I'm still relatively young and I'm eager to build my life into my dreams. Web Developing is one of the first steps in achieving my goals, because there is always a possible opportunity of working remotely. I may have big aspirations but with the right mindset and work ethic, I hope to one day achieve these goals.</p>
